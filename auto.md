1. "Spares" are meant to be full-size, you know, tires that you keep as *spares*. A donut is just something you use to get you to the closest tire shop.
1. Backup cameras don't clean themselves.
1. By the time you are done using your car by driving 200Mm on it, you will have spent at least $20k in fuel alone. Driving is not cheap. At least, in that scale, the L/100km figure will correspond to actual cash saved, i.e. 6L/100km saves you $8000 compared to 10L/100km over the vehicle's lifetime.
1. Turbocharged cars have different gearings. You don't just turbocharge a car without changing other parts.
1. Alex Lowell Dykes operates a car reviews youtube channel, *and* [a ceramic microscopy lab](http://dyklaine.com/).
1. You want an engine that delivers the max horsepower at the lowest torque. That's how an engine can be useful for propelling you forward.
1. The "double" part of double-declutch involves *you* rev-matching while in neutral: clutch pressed, neutral position on stick, clutch released, clutch pressed, shift to gear, clutch released (now you're in gear). "rev matching is something you should do regardless when dropping gears low enough."
1. Hold your steering wheel at 10 and 2 [only if you don't have power steering.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9fu3SBm-PU)
1. "You see what they've done here, this is organic tofu (toffu), dressed up as a juicy steak." - Clarkson on a CR-V hybrid
1. There is [a site](http://www.imcdb.org/vehicles.php?resultsStyle=asImages&sortBy=4&make=Toyota&model=Matrix&modelMatch=1&modelInclModel=on) for car appearances on the Internet, ranked by what the car did in the clip (part of the movie, used a lot, used by a character or in a car chase, background vehicle, ...)
1. [You can expect 7 cars to get into a collision every year.](http://toronto.citynews.ca/2015/11/26/car-accidents-on-the-rise-in-canada-toronto-study/) Most are non lethal, of course.
1. To check if a car is too big or too small [for you], adjust the seat and look at the B pillar (the middle one). If you can see the pillar next to you, the car is too small. If you cannot see the pillar next to you, it is big enough. (but maybe too big.)
1. "Mercedes-Benz" Sounds more like "Mare-SEE-dus Bens" in German.
1. When you replace two of the four tires, regardless of front wheel drive or rear wheel drive, however bald the remaining two are, [the new tires go to the rear](https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/shouldnt-the-new-tires-go-on-the-front/article621608/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&). Oversteer is much worse than understeer.
1. The 2016 civic was upgraded to be 100% hard touch plastic on the rear doors.
1. The Camry shared the same temperature knobs with the corolla at around the same time the corolla shared the same temperature knobs with the matrix. Rav4 also had the same knobs at some point. These cars also shared the same power door buttons, inside door handles, and possibly even the steering wheels.
1. To clean your engine bay, [vacuum away the dust before you wash it with water.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRSoRkM8GcM) Disconnect the battery. Don't get any water on the electricals. Actually, just scrap the whole idea of cleaning the engine bay.
1. The Veloster... [the driver's side has one big door, but the passenger side has two doors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3_3yv5JhgA). Hatch opens right over the rear passengers. Horsepower of a Corolla, with fuel economy worse than a Corolla. Less passenger space than a Corolla. Less trunk space than a Corolla. No spare tire. What the heck?
1. VW has a [VR engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VR6_engine) (Vmotorreihenmotor) that is a V engine, except a bit more stacked, closer to inline.
1. Car engines have mounts. [Otherwise, they pop out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/justrolledintotheshop/comments/57jlc4/_/)
1. Mechanics change your oil by first [pumping pressurised gas](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/5a22jc/never_trust_the_new_guy_to_drain_an_oil_bin/d9d3xg7/) into the "oil bins", emptying them.
1. If you end up being idiotic enough to buy a !Toyota, remember to take into account the [outrageous warranty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJNO6p54bUI) that you will want to buy.
1. If your car's clearcoat is coming off, just take off both the base and the clearcoat, and repaint the whole thing. [No other method, such as clearcoating over broken base coat, is really worth the savings.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU9JnLoJGGI) Clearcoating over old paint will never come out right.
1. > An unspecified [Cheiracanthium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheiracanthium) species is attracted to the smell of petroleum and has caused problems by weaving webs inside the canister vent of particular models of Mazda vehicles, resulting in blockages and build-up of pressure that could potentially cause fuel leakage from the fuel tank and an increased risk of fire. Mazda issued a voluntary recall of Mazda 6 models...
1. It is not legal (in many jurisdictions) to turn left into a left turn lane. The lane is only for turning left from it.
1. The right turn signal is meant to be used in a roundabout once you pass the exit before the one you intend to exit. This is consistent with other right hand turns.
1. Fiat 500 is called Fiat 500 because [it had a 479cc engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_500#Nuova_500_.281957.E2.80.931960.29), and because Fiat are Italian and round up willy nilly.
1. It is possible to over-tighten the bolts for the wheel nuts. Use a torque wrench to (do something...?)
1. Car commercials often [never feature the real car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnBC5bwV5y0).
1. The [optimal driving speeds](http://eartheasy.com/move_fuel_efficient_driving.html) are 50km/h and 90km/h.
1. To tell if a mechanic is honest, [take your car in for an unnecessary repair](http://lifehacker.com/take-your-car-in-for-an-unnecessary-repair-to-find-a-go-1545575350).
1. Both Tom and Max Chilton are racers. However, only Max's website was SEOed to say "CHILTON'S BAD LUCK CONTINUES AT THE KOHLER GRAND PRIX AT ROAD ..."
1. Herr Hitler sagte (SAAG te), "mein Auto sollte wie ein Käfer (KAY fer) aussehen (to appear)." Mister Hitler said, "my car should look like a beetle."
1. The first beetle was built by Dr. Porsche.
1. It is probably wise to buy cars based on its insurance cost, which is [apparently available in the form of a spreadsheet](http://www.ibc.ca/on/auto/buying-auto-insurance/how-auto-insurance-premiums/how-cars-measure-up).
1. Cheaper gasoline is sold to active farmers. It is called dyed diesel (because it is dyed, to...), or [purple gas](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/purple_gas) if it is actually gasoline.
1. [Adding automatic transmission fluid does not clean your engine](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/4b2kyu/my_sister_bought_a_car_that_has_missed_an_oil/d15mu5n); not sure why it must be said.
1. Buy Lexus, Toyota, or Subaru (in that order). Hondas made in Japan are also acceptable.
1. The ugly "Prius design" is called the [kammback](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kammback) exterior.
1. [Winter and all-season tires cannot be mixed](http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tiretech/techpage.jsp?techid=136)
1. Understeer: the front wheels are fully turned, but the car is still going forward.
1. Oversteer: the front wheels are turning fine, but the back is steering too much.
1. The [car colours that retain the most value](http://blog.unhaggle.com/4-reasons-car-colour-matter-buying-new-car/) are white, black, and grey. Birds love pooping on [red, blue, and black cars](https://ca.autos.yahoo.com/news/the-car-colours-bird-droppings-love-most-143754680.html). Bright colours also correlate to higher insurance premiums. To add on to the insult, [black cars get into accidents most often](http://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/blog/car-crash-by-colour/) because no one can see them, while silver cars are the safest.
1. The "prop shaft" is the propeller shaft (read: stick) that transfer energy from the engine to the wheel.
1. Pumping car tires with a bike pump actually works pretty well to top off the pressure but it'll take a good while to pump it up from flat. It won't be hard to pump though. 35 psi is really low for a bike tire.
1. The [parking pawl](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_pawl) locks your transmission in place when it is in "P". It is a weak mechanism. Never park a car on a hill with just the parking pawl, and always apply the hand brake *before* putting the car into park.
1. ["Rear-end gearing"](http://www.badasscars.com/index.cfm/page/ptype=product/product_id=398/category_id=13/mode=prod/prd398.htm) describes the gear ratio of the top gear. The lower it is, the fewer rotations per second the engine does, and the quieter the car is (on a highway).
1. It is impossible to engine brake on a CVT. In fact, CVTs are programmed to automatically apply the brake when no gas is given to it, simulating the ol' braking effect.
1. L/100km is better than MPG because L/100km is displayed in proportion to fuel used, not distance travelled (which appears to get larger in value as return deminishes).
1. [Laser > LED > HID > Halogen](http://www.caradvice.com.au/278125/headlights-explained-halogen-v-hid-v-led-v-laser/)
1. Boxer engines aren't called boxer engines because they look like boxes... they are called boxer engines because the pistons move relative to each other like boxers' hands.
1. When [European cars claim to have 60 mpg](https://www.google.ca/m?q=highest+mpg+european+cars), remember that is in Imperial gallons, which are 120% of a US gallon, making the car "only" 50 mpg.
1. [The mass air flow sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBJ_dsJPT7I) optimises the amount of fuel to inject into the engine by detecting the fuel-air ratio.
1. Normal car wheels expose the brakes to provide better air cooling for the brakes. EVs and hybrids often hide the brakes instead, to provide better aerodynamics for the car.
1. Over [90%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-_and_left-hand_traffic) of the world drives on the right.
1. That is the say, even in the middle of England, the [Savoy Hotel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savoy_Hotel#Savoy_Court_and_Savoy_Pier) has [right-hand drive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackney_carriage), for [some reason](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manganese_Bronze_Holdings).
1. (Local law) Your car's insurance is tied to you. Lending it to a friend who crashes it means an increase in your premium.
1. [Foglights are not so much designed to assist the driver's vision in the car which has them on, but rather to make that car more visible to other road users](http://www.bigfooty.com/forum/threads/foglights-why-on-earth-is-it-illegal-to-use-them.700813/). They are only to be used in adverse weather conditions, such as heavy rain or fog, and presumably, snow.
1. They are called "semi trucks" because it is a shortened version of "semi-trailer truck." A "semi-trailer" is actually just the trailer, but it is a trailer that only has wheels on one end...otherwise it would be a wagon. So the thing you call a semi, is actually a tractor, but refers to a trailer.
    * Truck = tractor.
    * Trailer = Wagon = wheels on both ends.
    * Semi-Trailer = wheels on one end.
    * Semi-Truck = tractor that pulls semi-trailers.
    Just like how Fire Trucks have ladders, but Fire Engines do not.
1. [Development mules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_mule) are cars that are camouflaged for hiding details while on their way to test centres.
1. In the event of a crash where the crash is captured by a dashcam, [read out the licence plate of the other car](https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2yy44n/lpt_if_you_have_a_dashcam_and_you_witness_an/). Also do the same for when you communicate with 911, which allows them to quickly identify the information when they replay the recording.
1. British licence plates are white in front and yellow at the back, to help people identify which way the car is going (it is hard to be sure, particularly when the Brits drive so slowly.)
1. [Propan-2-ol can remove most things from your car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCxxxxyd0Ps), as long as you understand that it won't be the most effective.
1. [With great ride comes with terrible handling](http://www.cartoq.com/modifying-your-car%E2%80%99s-suspension-to-make-it-stiffer-or-softer/); softening the suspension makes the car turn like a boat. This is also why sports cars have stiff suspensions (and horrible for your back).
1. [Almost all modern cars have synchromesh, if you don't have it fitted you will need to 'double declutch'](http://www.drivingfast.net/car-control/rev-matching.htm) ("to change to a lower gear in a motor vehicle by first placing the gear lever into the neutral position before engaging the desired gear, at the same time releasing the clutch pedal and increasing the engine speed")
1. Diesel fuel systems cannot contain air. If a diesel car runs empty, the system needs to be "bled" of air before refuelling.
1. All countries, except USA and Canada, follow UNECE standards (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) for cars. This is why we get so few car models.
1. [Manual cars don't have park.](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-152702.html). ~~Automatic cars don't have a clutch (they have torque converters)~~.
1. Diesel engines somehow need to be made from steel (except when VW makes them, in which case they are made in aluminium)
1. The higher the tire's [aspect ratio number](https://www.google.com/search?q=tire+aspect+ratio+chart), the smoother the ride you can expect the car to be. For example, 100/90R15 would be smoother than 100/50R15.
1. It is also true that the lower the aspect ratio is, the less likely the tire would distort, improving handling.
1. Car bumpers designed to [withstand impact speeds up to 10mph](http://m.carcomplaints.com/Toyota/Matrix/2009/body_paint/structure-body-bumpers.shtml).
1. "Widening a road makes more cars drive on it" is called [induced demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand#/search).
1. [Car bumpers don't work if they don't bump into each other, obviously.](https://youtube.com/watch?v=yLW2OVtP6_w) The consequence is very costly collisions, which benefit the auto makers.
1. [Scion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_%28grafting%29) is a branch to be grafted into/onto another tree, hence the name of the car brand, which was branched off Toyota.
1. [The DeLorean was not painted.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Shitty_Car_Mods/comments/4zc98z/beautiful_blasphemy/) Its colour comes from stainless steel.
1. Not only is bird poo acidic, the fact that they [expand and contract on top of the paint](http://www.caradvice.com.au/117729/bird-poo-paint-damage-explained-how-to-protect-your-car/) contributes to paint damage over time.
1. Do not sign blank auto mechanic authorisation forms. Also, [do not tell your mechanic what another mechanic thinks it is, and how much it think it costs to fix it.](http://www.rd.com/advice/saving-money/13-things-your-car-mechanic-wont-tell-you-slideshow/), and ask for your old parts back, so you know they changed them. CPO cars are rarely certified, so don't bother with those, either.
1. An AWD vehicle like the Ford Fusion requires all tires to be the same radius, even taking tire wear into account. Failure to do so [will break the differential](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/5c1x9c/why_you_dont_replace_one_tire_on_an_awd_fusion/). Some AWD/4WD systems [don't even engage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkiv-bWbLIo). [It is often better to just buy a F/F car.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/5c1x9c/why_you_dont_replace_one_tire_on_an_awd_fusion/d9tdw6d/)
1. You are supposed to [return to the auto shop and retorque your wheels](http://www.reddit.com/r/justrolledintotheshop/comments/58z12z/_/), especially if the wheel and hub are made of different materials. Otherwise, [this](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/11/22/watch-snow-tire-fly-off-vehicle-on-hwy-407.html) can happen.
1. "Performing a burnout in a front wheel drive vehicle is likely to result in damage to the drivetrain."
1. In the case of an emergency radiator leak (in which case, you won't be reading this), [pinch the places where it is leaking.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Justrolledintotheshop/comments/54rcdw/when_in_a_pinch_pinch_the_passages_no_leaks/)
1. Also, eggs in the radiator will not work. The only thing you can put in is egg *whites*, and even that works terribly.
1. Deer whistles don't work, either.
1. If the battery is dead, every light except the battery light comes on.
1. "Trail braking" is releasing the brake when you are half-way into a turn, whose point is called the [apex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apex_%28racing%29).
1. [Chicanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicanes) are two 90-degree turns designed to slow you down.
1. [Underdrive pulleys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdrive_pulleys) turn at a slower speed than stock. They increase horsepower by removing power from accessories like the AC.
1. The [Ford Excursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Excursion), no longer made, was apparently criticised for being too large of an SUV. At 5.7m long, it is the same length as the [Chevrolet Suburban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Suburban#2017), which is still on sale today.
1. The longer your vehicle is, the more it feels, when you tow a trailer, that you are towing, rather than the trailer towing you. This is unfortunately not something a car can compensate by any other dimension.
1. Having more exhausts can potentially raise horsepower, but really not by much (1, maybe 2). See Dodge Durango.
1. Double parking means occupying a lane with hazards on, not occupying two parking spots.
1. Canada is [**not**](http://www.city-data.com/forum/canada/2017072-commonwealth-right-side-traffic.html) the only commonwealth country to drive on the right.
1. In Europe, only four countries still drive on the left: the United Kingdom, Ireland, Malta, and Cyprus, all of which are islands.
1. Don't own a Tesla out of warranty. "The only place you can get them repaired is at the dealership for whatever price they feel like", "you've got to wait months for parts to come in".
1. [Car designs are patented piecewise.](http://google.com/patents/USD635067)
1. On the page for top 10 stolen cars, [the results](http://www.ibc.ca/nt/auto/theft/top-ten-stolen-cars?y=2016#stolen-cars) are mostly trucks.
1. In 2016, only four cars from 2013 have below-average insurance costs: Buick Verano, Chevy Impala, Honda Fit, and Subaru Outback (just average).
1. Traction control can be quite fun to turn off before [you kill yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I86mQZJWabU). Traction control became a EU requirement in 2014.
1. Overinflation, dropping trunk junk, throwing away your spare tire, change tires to low resistance tires... [none of these are useful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39g5D7h7jf8) for increasing fuel economy. What does, however, is simply driving carefully. (Video claims that to make a single low-resistance tire worth it, you have to drive 45Mm.)
1. That old bloke on Fifth Gear is Tiff Needell, a racing driver.
1. Cars with soft tops don't get automatic car washes.
1. "Paying more than what the car is worth" for repairs is fine, as long as you don't do more repairs per year than your year's worth of monthly payments for a new(er) car, which is a bit hard to beat. For example: even if you spend $4000 on old car repairs every year, which is hardly ever possible, it is still cheaper than financing a car that goes for $400 a month, until it's done, anyway.
1. At least one car out there has been named [*Patricia*](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/64myo1/what_are_some_green_flags_in_a_relationship/dg3tpx6/) before. According to the theory of infinite parallel universes, there ought to be a car out there named *Scarlet*, as well.
1. You named your own car *Scarlet*. Scarlet reminds you of Snowball, [whose fur is pretty and white](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I1u8HLw4-as).
1. [H and V-rated tires don't last as long (but stop better).](http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/news/2009/10/h-rated-tires-with-shorter-life-spans-become-more-common/index.htm) Consider getting S or T-rated tires instead, if you can bloody find them.
1. [When a road's speed limit changes, the people driving on it are slow to go to that speed, whether faster or slower.](https://priceonomics.com/is-every-speed-limit-too-low/) Accident rates are also weakly correlated to road speed, but does increase dramatically "when some cars drive 55 mph and others drive 85 mph".
1. [Apparently](http://urbantoronto.ca/forum/threads/avoid-engine-brakes.6914/), trucks [make a loud noise when they engine brake](https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080219161253AAtHpRU). They can also go out of control if engine braked.
1. Scion xB owners embrace their toasters so much, they [actually](http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8145/7541149164_64365585e8_b.jpg) convert [their cars](http://www.clubxb.com/forums/attachments/general-scion-xb-discussion/6650d1183038369-now-thats-toaster-toaster.jpg) [into](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/ac/1f/3b/ac1f3b0d11e51e2e4a27e83237aed35d.jpg) [toasters](http://www.importequipment.com/OnlineStore/images/403-scion-xb-i-love-my-toas.jpg).
1. If you get a quote from a car repair shop (in Ontario), [the max amount they can overcharge for other repairs is 10%](https://www.ontario.ca/page/car-repair-shops-your-rights) IF you respond in time (i.e. before they put the car back together). Parts and labour also have a mandatory 90-day/5000-km warranty, whichever one comes first.
1. And if you don't pay for a repair, the shop can just seize and sell your car. So the trick is to buy a car that is worthless when sold.
1. Depending on the trim, the [2017 Tacoma](https://www.toyota.ca/toyota/en/vehicles/tacoma/overview) has either the badge on the front (normal ones) or `T O Y O T A` (TRD pro). In other news, "oh yeah, the 2015 Yaris is so ugly, they can't possibly make it wors-[well what do you know.](https://preview2.netcarshow.com/Toyota-Yaris-2017-1600-0e.jpg)"
