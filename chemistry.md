1. "2-Nonenal. It is what makes [old people smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_person_smell)... well like old people." (Unfounded)
1. "Spermine. Smells like...well, sperm. Pyrrolidine. Also smells like..well, sperm."
1. The damage from ingesting a [button cell battery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Button_cell) is caused by the electric current it creates, which causes sodium hydroxide to build up and burn through the oesophagus and into major blood vessels, which can cause fatal bleeding.
1. Samarium is element 62. Although classified as a rare earth element, there is more samarium in the Earth's crust than tin.

1. An [ampere](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere) is a coulomb per second. All of them are considered SI units.
1. Methanoic acid is poured into rubber tree sap to make rubber. Drying rubber turns it yellow. That's why rubber bands are yellow.
1. *c* is not the speed of light; *c* is ~3e8 m/s, and light happens to travel at that speed. So we call that the speed of light. But other things travel at *c*, too.
1. Brushing teeth after breakfast does not work. [It just brushes the food and acid (in the case of orange juice) around.](https://www.quora.com/Should-you-brush-your-teeth-before-or-after-breakfast)
1. Calcium ammonium nitrate is hygroscopic. Its dissolution in water is endothermic, leading to its use in some instant cold packs.
1. [Pure carbonic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbonic_acid#Pure_carbonic_acid) can be made by "...exposing a frozen mixture of water and carbon dioxide to high-energy proton radiation, and then warming to remove the excess water...", or "...a cryogenic reaction of potassium bicarbonate and HCl dissolved in methanol."
1. [Soaps are usually fatty acids](http://www.quirkyscience.com/difference-soap-detergent/). Instead of an acid, detergents may have sulfate or sulfonate groups instead.
1. Cyclohexanhexone aka [Brianone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclohexanehexone), a useless compound, has never been synthesised industrially.

1. [Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Hydroxybutyric_acid) (GHB) and [Gamma-Butyrolactone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Butyrolactone) (GBL, the prodrug) have date-rape effects. Fun fact, it is not illegal to possess GBL in Canada.
1. Use [disiamylborane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disiamylborane) to turn terminal alkynes into aldehydes.
1. [Diethyl ether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diethyl_ether) can be used as a general anesthetic.
1. [Isovaleric acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-Methylbutanoic_acid) is your cheesy feet smell.

1. Tubes must be inserted in pairs in a [centrifuge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_centrifuge#Microcentrifuge_tubes) so they spin balanced.
1. There is no such thing as a "frame of reference" for a photon. Photons do not have positions.
1. [Thioacetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thioacetone) is a molecule so stinky that few have studied it.
1. If you charge a lithium ion battery to 60% and stop, the wear is 0.1 cycles worth. 70%? 0.14. [80%? 0.26.](https://accubattery.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210384245-Quick-start-infographic?mobile_site=false) 85%? 0.35. 90%? 0.48. 95%? 0.66. 100%? 1, obviously. Battery life still depends on the actual hours since made, so just because 1/0.26 = 3.84, it doesn't mean you get a battery that lasts 3.8x longer (more like 2). The equation appears to follow `y = 0.0027 * e^{5.8x}`.
1. [Keto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautomer) form is the one with a ketone group; Enol form is the one with that ketone group reduced to an alcohol group, but a nearby C-C sigma bond hybridising with a pi (aka double bond). [Keto-enol tautomerism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keto%E2%80%93enol_tautomerism) occurs in aqueous solutions only (faster if either acidic or basic).
1. When cereal makers say they add iron to it, [they actually add solid Fe-0](http://littleshop.physics.colostate.edu/Try%20At%20Home/IronCereal.htm). Not even oxide, just iron.
1. Replacing BPA with [BPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_F) or [BPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_S) (i.e. "BPA-free") is [not that great](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuMGc0EswTc&feature=youtu.be). BPF/BPS can alter testosterone levels.

1. [Pop fizzes more when you shake it](https://www.scienceabc.com/pure-sciences/why-a-soft-drink-bottle-fizzes-when-opened.html) as a direct consequence of you adding energy into the bottle by shaking it. More energy upsets the equilibrium, giving trapped gas enough energy to break surface tension, forming bubbles.
1. [The mint lifesaver glows in the dark when bitten into.](http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question505.htm) "Actually, all hard sugar-based candies emit some degree of light when you bite them, but most of the time, that light is very faint." Crystalline sugar emits energy as UV light when crushed, and the methyl salicylate in that mint absorbs UV light and emits visible light.
1. [TNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinitrotoluene) is not [trinitroglycerin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitroglycerin), which can be made by slowly adding 1:1 HNO3/H2SO4 into cold glycerol. The HNO3/H2SO4 process is done twice for TNT, plus an extra nitration step using HNO3 and oleum (apparently).
1. Whatever you used to call "precipitate out", apparently professional chemists just call "crash out". It involves making a soluble compound insoluble by, well, changing the solubility of the solvent.
1. Only elements lighter than iron can be used for [nuclear fusion](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_binding_energy#/media/File%3ABinding_energy_curve_-_common_isotopes.svg) and still yield energy.

1. "Cultured celery extract" is marketing's way of saying (sodium) nitrite, a cancerous food preservative.
1. Opoids cause constipation.
1. Epsom salt in a bath does nothing medically beneficial. It is also impossible to get too much magnesium from epsom salt baths. People go into saturated magnesium sulphate baths in isolation tanks all the time, and none of them were poisoned by it.
1. It is possible to ["accidentally make an explosive"](http://epigram.org.uk/news/2017/02/41190), [TATP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone_peroxide), by mixing acetone and hydrogen peroxide. *Wolffenstein combined acetone and hydrogen peroxide, and then he allowed the mixture to stand for a week at room temperature, during which time a small quantity of crystals precipitated*. The resulting powder is [fairly useless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEdnNOi6DS4).
1. [Mineral wool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral_wool) is a bunch of mineral fibres spun together.
1. Biodiesel came from used cooking oil and cow hide processing. Proponents say biodiesel contains less cancer-causing particles.

1. DEET is a solvent. It should not be used on plastics and painted surfaces.
1. In zinc batteries, [the housing is the anode.](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-zinc-and-alkaline/) This means the housing is consumed when the battery is used, making it more prone to leakage.
1. [Putrescine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrescine), apart from making up the smell of dead flesh, also contributes to smells like bad breath, bacterial vaginosis, and semen.
1. "[Cocaethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaethylene)" is formed by the liver when cocaine and ethanol coexist in the blood. Apparently it ... carries an 18- to 25-fold increase over cocaine alone in risk of immediate death. Or, if you are an optimist, you may find your chance of dying from cocaine alone at most 1/18 as likely as this cocaethylene thing.
1. [/u/SimplyOriginal](https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/2quas2/weed_as_a_party_drug/cn9ncl8/) posts about maximising alcohol's per-unit potential: *Eat [fatty foods and carbs] 45mins before your first drink [to] slow down the absorption rate. Maintain a [steady] increase of [BAC]. Stick to one type of alcohol [to maintain the feel-good effects. Do not] hammer shots.*
1. Cocaine stops being detectable in fluids after a few days.
1. Lasers burn away rust, but not with the iron underneath, because rust absorbs more light than iron.
1. (Throwback Wednesday) Buffer solutions can only be made from [weak acids](http://chemcollective.org/activities/tutorials/buffers/buffers3) (and their conjugate bases). When a strong acid is added, the conjugate base neutralises it. When a strong base is added, the acid protonates, neutralising the base. In both cases, the pH did not change much.
1. Aluminium cookware can potentially add [1~2mg](http://www.livestrong.com/article/475155-health-risks-of-cooking-in-aluminum/) of it to your diet per day. The upper limit is 85mg. Better safe than sorry.
1. The [pH of urine](https://www.rnceus.com/ua/uaph.html) can vary wildly from 4.5 to 8. It correlates to whatever pH your body is, which can be low (dehydration) or high (crazy illnesses, see link).
1. [Oxalic acid](https://www.livescience.com/56237-why-spinach-makes-teeth-feel-weird.html) is the cause of spinach making your teeth feel funny. Too much (now calcium oxalate) in your kidneys become kidney stones.
1. Henna is light brown. There is no such thing as black henna. [Black henna is P-Phenylenediamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-Phenylenediamine), which is a banned skin irritant (for henna).
